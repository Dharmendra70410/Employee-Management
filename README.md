# Employee-Management
This project, created as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) curriculum, demonstrates the principles and applications of OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The project aims to provide a practical implementation of OOP principles through a real-world scenario.

Objective: To build a scalable and user-friendly system for managing employee information, showcasing the benefits of OOP concepts.

Key Features:
1.Class Structure: Separate classes for Employee, Department, and Management to model the system.
2.Encapsulation: Employee details and operations are managed securely using private attributes and methods.
3.Inheritance: Specialized classes inherit common properties and methods from base classes.
4.Polymorphism: Implemented via method overloading and overriding for flexibility in operations.
5.Abstraction: Simplifies user interaction by hiding unnecessary details.

Technology Stack:

Language: Python
Libraries: Utilized libraries such as datetime for time management.
